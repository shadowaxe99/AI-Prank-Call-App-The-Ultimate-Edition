A detailed comparison between the two folders revealed that they are almost identical.
The only difference lies in the 'wsgi.py' file located in the 'config' subfolder.

Line-by-line differences in 'wsgi.py':
  import os

- 

  from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application

  

  os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'config.settings')

- 

  application = get_wsgi_application()

To create the 'best' version of the folder, the following steps were taken:
1. The entire first folder was copied as the base.
2. The alternative version of 'wsgi.py' from the second folder was included and renamed to 'wsgi_alternative.py'.
